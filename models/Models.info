Models are the files where you interact with your database.
They contain all the methods and functions which will handle your data.
This includes not only the methods for creating, reading, updating and
deleting items, but also any additional business logic. For example,
if you had a car model, you could have a mountTyres method.

You should also try to make your models independent from the outside world.
They don’t need to know about other models and they should never include them.
They don’t need to know about controllers or who uses them. They should never
receive request or response objects. They should never return http errros,
but they should return model specific errors.

No models in this project.
