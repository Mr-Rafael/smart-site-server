In this folder, you will store all your Express middlewares. The purpose of a
middleware is to extract a common controller code, which should be executed on
multiple requests and usually modifies the request and/or the response objects.

Just like a controller, a middleware should never directly access the database.
Instead it should use your models for such tasks.

In this project there're no middlewares.
