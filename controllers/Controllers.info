This is the folder where you will be defining all the routes that your app
will serve. Your controllers will handle web requests, serve your templates
to the user and interact with your models to process and retrieve data. It’s
the glue which connects and controls your web app.

A best practice is that a controller should never directly access the database.
It should never call methods like “write”, “update”, “fetch” which most
database drivers provide. Instead it should rely on model methods.

This project has Controllers:
- meter.js
- index.js
